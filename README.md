## **Day 1: Git for Designers**

  

### **Introduction to Git**

  

**What is Git?**

  

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work, making it ideal for collaboration in design and development projects.

  

**Importance of Version Control in Design**

  

Version control systems like Git are crucial for managing design files, ensuring that changes are tracked, and allowing easy collaboration between designers and developers. It helps avoid issues like file overwrites, enables reverting to previous versions, and provides a history of changes.

  

**Git vs. Other Version Control Systems**

  

While there are other version control systems like SVN and Mercurial, Git has become the industry standard due to its powerful branching and merging features, distributed nature, and speed.

  

### **Key Git Concepts**

  

**Repository**

  

A repository (or “repo”) is a directory that contains your project files and the entire history of changes made to those files.

  

**Commit**

  

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. It includes a message describing the changes made, helping you keep track of the project’s history.

  

**Branch**

  

A branch is a separate line of development. Branches allow multiple developers (or designers) to work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

  

**Merge**

  

Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch.

  

### **Setting Up Git**

  

**Installing Git**

  

To install Git on your computer:

  

- **Windows:** [Download Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

- **macOS:** Git is pre-installed. Alternatively, you can install it via Homebrew with `brew install git`.

- **Linux:** Install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git` for Ubuntu.

  

**Configuring Git**

  

Set up your Git username and email, which will be used in your commit messages:

  

```bash

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

```

  

**Setting Up SSH Keys**

  

SSH keys are used to securely connect to your remote repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

  

1. Generate an SSH key:

  

```bash

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"

```

  

2. Add the SSH key to your SSH agent:

  

```bash

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

```

  

3. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

  

```bash

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

```

  

4. Add the SSH key to your GitHub/GitLab account.

  

**Resource:** [Git Setup Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

  

### **Basic Git Commands**

  

- **Initialize a Repository:** `git init`

- **Clone a Repository:** `git clone [repository-url]`

- **Add Changes:** `git add [file]` or `git add .`

- **Commit Changes:** `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

- **Push Changes:** `git push origin [branch-name]`

- **Pull Changes:** `git pull origin [branch-name]`

  

### **Git Workflow for Designers**

  

1. **Cloning a Repository**

  

To start working on a project, first, clone the repository to your local machine:

  

```bash

git clone [repository-url]

```

  

2. **Creating and Switching Branches**

  

Always create a new branch for your work:

  

```bash

git checkout -b feature/design-update

```

  

3. **Making Commits**

  

As you work on your design, stage and commit your changes:

  

```bash

git add .

git commit -m "Updated design assets for homepage"

```

  

4. **Pushing Changes**

  

Push your changes to the remote repository:

  

```bash

git push origin feature/design-update

```

  

5. **Creating a Pull Request**

  

Once your work is complete, create a pull request (PR) for review. This is a crucial step for collaboration, as it allows others to review your changes before they are merged into the main branch.

  

**Resource:** [GitHub Pull Request Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

  

### **Managing Design Assets with Git**

  

**Organizing Files**

  

Organize your design files in a clear, hierarchical structure to make it easy for others to find and collaborate on them.

  

**Handling Large Files**

  

For large binary files (e.g., PSDs, AI files), use Git LFS (Large File Storage). Install Git LFS and track large files:

  

```bash

git lfs install

git lfs track "*.psd"

```

  

**Best Practices**

  

- Commit frequently with meaningful messages.

- Use branches for different features or tasks.

- Regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your branch up to date.

  

### **Collaborating with Developers**

  

**Pull Requests**

  

Always submit a pull request for your changes, even if they’re just design files. This allows developers to review and integrate your work into the codebase.

  

**Code Reviews**

  

Participate in code reviews to understand how your design changes impact the code and vice versa. This fosters better collaboration and ensures alignment between design and development.

  

**Merge Conflicts**

  

If you encounter merge conflicts (e.g., two people edited the same file), resolve them by comparing the changes and deciding which version to keep.

  

**Resource:** [Git Merge Conflicts Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtIX3HJKwfo)

## **Day 2: Docker and Containers**

  

### **Introduction to Docker**

  

**What is Docker?**

  

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker allows you to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.

  

**Importance of Containers in Modern Development**

  

Containers ensure that software runs consistently regardless of the environment it is deployed in. This is crucial in design workflows where design tools and environments need to be consistent across different machines and teams.

  

**Docker vs. Virtual Machines**

  

Unlike virtual machines, which replicate an entire OS, containers share the host system’s OS kernel but run isolated processes. This makes containers more lightweight and faster to start.

  

### **Benefits of Using Docker**

  

- **Portability:** Containers can run on any environment that supports Docker, from local development machines to cloud servers.

- **Consistency:** Docker ensures that the environment is the same across development, staging, and production, reducing the “it works on my machine” problem.

- **Isolation:** Containers isolate applications, ensuring that dependencies and configurations do not conflict between different projects.

  

### **Docker Architecture**

  

**Docker Engine**

  

The core of Docker is the Docker Engine, which includes the Docker daemon, REST API, and CLI.

  

**Images and Containers**

  

- **Images:** A Docker image is a read-only template that includes everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables.

- **Containers:** A container is a running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

  

**Docker Hub and Registries**

  

Docker Hub is a public registry where you can find and share container images. You can also set up private registries for your organization.

  

### **Basic Docker Concepts**

  

**Images**

  

Images are built from a Dockerfile, which contains instructions for

  

building the image. Images are immutable and can be shared via Docker Hub or private registries.

  

**Containers**

  

Containers are created from images. They are ephemeral by nature, meaning that they can be started, stopped, and destroyed without affecting the image they were created from.

  

**Dockerfile**

  

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions to build a Docker image. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image.

  

**Resource:** [Dockerfile Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)

  

### **Installing Docker**

  

**Windows and macOS**

  

Download Docker Desktop from [Docker’s official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Docker Desktop provides an easy-to-use interface for managing containers and images.

  

**Linux**

  

Install Docker using your package manager:

  

```bash

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

```

  

**Post-Installation Setup**

  

After installation, you may need to add your user to the Docker group to run Docker commands without `sudo`:

  

```bash

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

```

  

### **Basic Docker Commands**

  

- **Pull an Image:** `docker pull [image-name]`

- **Run a Container:** `docker run -d -p 80:80 [image-name]`

- **Build an Image:** `docker build -t [image-name] .`

- **List Running Containers:** `docker ps`

- **Stop a Container:** `docker stop [container-id]`

- **Remove an Image:** `docker rmi [image-name]`

  

### **Managing Docker Containers**

  

**Starting and Stopping Containers**

  

You can start and stop containers using `docker start [container-id]` and `docker stop [container-id]`. This allows you to pause and resume your work without losing your setup.

  

**Inspecting Container Status**

  

Use `docker inspect [container-id]` to get detailed information about a running container, including its environment variables, network settings, and more.

  

**Removing Containers and Images**

  

To clean up resources, use `docker rm [container-id]` to remove containers and `docker rmi [image-name]` to remove images.

  

### **Docker Compose**

  

**Introduction to Docker Compose**

  

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can use a YAML file to configure your application’s services, networks, and volumes.

  

**Defining Multi-Container Applications**

  

Here’s an example `docker-compose.yml` file:

  

```yaml

version: '3'

services:

web:

image: nginx

ports:

- "80:80"

database:

image: mysql

environment:

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

```

  

**Example Docker Compose File for a Design Tool**

  

You can use Docker Compose to define a stack that includes a design tool and its dependencies. This could be useful for setting up a consistent design environment across your team.

  

**Resource:** [Docker Compose Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

  

### **Docker for Designers**

  

**Managing Design Environments**

  

Docker allows you to package design tools and their dependencies into containers, ensuring that your design environment is consistent across different machines.

  

**Running Design Tools in Containers**

  

You can run design tools inside containers to avoid installing them directly on your machine. For example, you could run an instance of Figma or a specific version of Photoshop in a Docker container.

  

**Integrating Docker with Design Workflows**

  

By containerizing your design tools, you can easily share your environment with other team members, ensuring that everyone is working in the same setup.

## **Day 5: Continuous Deployment (CD)**

  

### **Introduction to CD**

  

**Definition and Difference from Continuous Delivery**

  

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development practice where every code change that passes all stages of the CI pipeline is automatically released into production. This differs from Continuous Delivery, where code is continuously delivered to a staging environment but requires manual approval to be deployed to production.

  

**Importance of CD in Design and Development Workflows**

  

CD ensures that design changes are automatically deployed to production as soon as they are validated, reducing the time between development and release. This is crucial for maintaining a fast-paced design and development cycle.

  

**Benefits of Automation in Deployment**

  

- **Speed:** Automate the deployment process to deliver updates faster.

- **Consistency:** Ensure that deployments are consistent and error-free.

- **Scalability:** Handle large and complex projects with ease by automating the deployment process.

  

### **CD Workflow**

  

**Stages: Build, Test, Deploy**

  

- **Build:** Compile and package the application or design assets.

- **Test:** Run automated tests to validate the changes.

- **Deploy:** Automatically deploy the changes to production or a staging environment.

  

**Automation and Orchestration**

  

CD pipelines are designed to be fully automated, from the moment code is committed to when it is deployed to production. Tools like Codefresh and Jenkins can orchestrate these processes, ensuring that each stage is executed in the correct order.

  

**Monitoring and Feedback**

  

CD pipelines include monitoring tools that track the success of deployments and provide feedback on performance, allowing teams to quickly address any issues.

  

**Resource:** [Continuous Deployment Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIAP44noNoU)

  

### **CD in the Design Workflow**

  

**Deploying Design Assets to Staging and Production**

  

Design assets, such as images, fonts, and stylesheets, can be automatically deployed to staging and production environments as part of the CD pipeline.

  

**Automating Updates to Design Systems**

  

Design systems can be updated and deployed automatically, ensuring that all projects have access to the latest components and styles.

  

**Integrating Design Deployments with Code Deployments**

  

By integrating design and code deployments, you ensure that design changes are released in tandem with the corresponding code updates, maintaining consistency across the application.

  

### **Benefits of CD for Designers**

  

- **Faster Delivery of Design Changes:** CD enables quick deployment of design updates, reducing time to market.

- **Enhanced Collaboration with Development Teams:** By integrating design changes into the CD pipeline, designers can work more closely with developers, ensuring that design and code changes are aligned.

- **Improved Quality and Consistency:** Automated testing and deployment ensure that design assets are consistently deployed across all environments.

  

### **CD Best Practices**

  

**Version Control for Design Assets**

  

Use version control to manage design assets, ensuring that all changes are tracked and that you can revert to previous versions if needed.

  

**Automated Testing and Validation**

  

Include automated tests in your CD pipeline to validate design assets before they are deployed. This can include visual regression tests, linting, and performance tests.

  

**Rollback Strategies and Deployment Safety**

  

Implement rollback strategies in your CD pipeline to ensure that you can quickly revert to a previous version if something goes wrong during deployment. This can be done using feature toggles, blue-green deployments, or canary releases.

  

### **CD Strategies**

  

**Blue-Green Deployment**

  

Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy where two identical environments are maintained: one (blue) is the live environment, and the other (green) is a staging environment. When a new version is ready, it is deployed to the green environment, tested, and then traffic is switched over from blue to green.

  

**Canary Releases**

  

Canary Releases involve gradually rolling out a new version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base. This allows you to test the new version in a real-world environment without affecting all users.

  

**Feature Toggles**

  

Feature Toggles allow you to deploy new features to production while keeping them hidden behind a toggle. You can then enable the feature for specific users or at a specific time, without needing to redeploy the application.

  

### **Implementing CD with Codefresh**

  

**Setting Up Deployment Pipelines in Codefresh**

  

Codefresh provides an easy-to-use interface for setting up deployment pipelines. You can define your pipeline steps using a YAML file and configure them to automatically deploy your application or design assets to production.

**Resource:** [Codefresh Continuous Deployment Guide](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/ci-cd-guides/continuous-deployment/)

  

### **Security and Compliance in CD**

  

**Managing Secrets and Sensitive Data**

  

Use tools like Codefresh’s Secrets Management feature to securely store and manage sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Ensure that your CD pipeline is configured to securely handle these secrets during deployment.

  

**Ensuring Compliance with Design and Data Standards**

  

Include compliance checks in your CD pipeline to ensure that all design assets meet your organization’s standards for accessibility, performance, and security. Use tools like automated accessibility testing and code linting to enforce these standards.

  

**Automating Security Checks in the Deployment Pipeline**

  

Incorporate security scanning tools into your CD pipeline to automatically check for vulnerabilities in your design assets and code. Tools like OWASP ZAP, Snyk, and Trivy can be integrated into your pipeline to provide continuous security monitoring.

  

**Resource:** [Codefresh Security Best Practices](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/enterprise/security/)
